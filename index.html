            Earth:
        </h2>
        <p1 style="color: aliceblue;">
            &#8226;Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

            Moon:
        </h2>
        <p2 style="color: aliceblue;">
            &#8226;The moon is Earth's natural satellite, the largest in our solar system relative to its primary planet. It's a rocky, dusty body that orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,399 kilometers.

                Key Facts about the Moon:
            </h3>
            <div style="color: aliceblue;">
            <br>&bull;Natural Satellite: The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, meaning it's a celestial body that orbits Earth naturally.</br>
            <br>&#8226;Size and Distance: It's about one-fourth the width of Earth and is located at an average distance of 384,399 kilometers from Earth.</br> 
            <br>&bull;Gravity: The gravity on the Moon is about one-sixth of Earth's gravity.</br>
            <br>&#8226;Tidal Influence: The Moon's gravitational pull is the primary cause of tides on Earth.</br>
            <br>&bull;Surface: The Moon's surface is mostly rocky and dusty, with numerous craters, rilles (channels or troughs), and maria (large, dark areas that are actually volcanic plains).</br>

            Star:
        </h2>
        <p3 style="color: aliceblue;">
            A star is a large, luminous sphere of plasma held together by gravity. These celestial bodies are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and they shine due to nuclear fusion reactions occurring in their cores. The Sun, the star closest to Earth, is a prime example of a star.

        </div>
        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">
            Composition and Formation:
        </h3>
         <br style="color: aliceblue;">&#8226;Stars are formed from large clouds of gas and dust, called nebulae, that collapse under their own gravity. As the material condenses, it heats up until nuclear fusion ignites, creating a star.</br> 
        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">
            Life Cycle:
        </h3>
        <br style="color: aliceblue;">&bull;Stars have a life cycle that can range from millions to billions of years. During their main sequence, stars fuse hydrogen into helium, producing light and energy. Eventually, they exhaust their fuel and evolve into red giants, white dwarfs, or other stellar remnants depending on their mass.</br> 
        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">
            Star Systems:
        </h3>
        <br style="color: aliceblue;">&#8226;Many stars exist in binary or multiple star systems, where two or more stars are gravitationally bound to each other.</br>

             Milky Way galaxy:
        </h2>
        <p4>
            The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our solar system and is a large barred spiral galaxy. It appears as a faint, milky band of light across the night sky, which is made up of billions of stars, dust, and gas. Our Sun is located in one of the Milky Way's spiral arms, about 25,000 light-years away from the galaxy's center.

            Structure:
        </h3>
        <br>&#8226;The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, meaning it has a central bar of stars and a disk with spiral arms extending outwards.</br>
        <h3>
            Size:
        </h3>
         <br>&bull;It's estimated to be about 100,000 light-years across and about 1000 light-years thick.</br>

            Constellation:
        </h2>
        <p5>
            A constellation is a recognized pattern of stars in the night sky, often depicted as resembling an animal, mythological figure, or object. These patterns are used to help orient oneself in the sky and to identify celestial locations. Constellations are areas on the celestial sphere, not just a group of stars, with boundaries defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
